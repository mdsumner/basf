Title: Plot Simple Features with 'base' Sensibilities
Description: Resurrects the standard plot for shapes established by the
 'base' and 'graphics' packages. This is suited to workflows that require
 constant efficient plotting using the established and traditional idioms so 
 that results can be checked without constantly working around specialty 
 formats. This package depends on 'sf' and only replaces the disruptive 'plot.sf' 
 method, so in theory it can be used in place (with a two-character code change).
